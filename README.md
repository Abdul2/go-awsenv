### short golang programme to set aws env values


####Â why


	using aws cli and credentials file i can make a cli mfa authonticated api call. this creates json file
	in ~/.aws/cli/cache with session credentials. to make session credentials availble to other tools that 
	expect env values such as terraforma, this short programme helps me to avoid a manual cut and paste operation

### how

	clone and run
